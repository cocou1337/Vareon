Pxlcon is an tiny pixel art editor for the terminal, which you control with the keyboard instead of the mouse. It is a port of `pxltrm` to PowerShell, aiming for full cross-platform compatibility.

- **Lightweight** (less than 1.38 KB)
- **RGB color support** (for true-color terminals)
- Ability to write projects to a file.
- View pixel art in the terminal with `cat`.

**Note:** This project is currently WIP. If you break it or want a feature, file an issue!


## Dependencies

- PowerShell 5 (or later)
- .NET 4.5 (or later)
- True-color terminal (optional)


## Installation

- Move `pxltrm` somewhere in your `$PATH`.


## TODO

- [ ] Implement undo/redo feature.
- [ ] Test on *nix systems and macOS.
- [ ] Implement color palette.
